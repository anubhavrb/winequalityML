\begin{abstract}
This is a machine learning project that focused on predicting the quality of red and white wine using existing datasets. In this project, we will train, validate, and test four regression models: the linear regression model, the SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) model, the Ridge model (L-2 norm), and the Lasso model (L-1 norm). After conducting series of experiments on these models, we rank their performances based on the results of wine quality prediction. Our analysis shows that Ridge gives the highest score, outperforming the other three, for both red and white wine. We think such model can be useful to support educational wine tasting activities to improve wine production, and can help businesses better understand consumer needs.
